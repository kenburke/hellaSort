# hellaSort
Complete semi-automatic neuronal spike sorting GUIspike sorting software written in MATLAB. 

This interactive GUI permits the user to explore their waveforms and either use a gaussian mixture model to cluster spikes or manually cluster in a 2D PCA space. 

The user can vary the number of clusters and assess the impact of the chosen clusters on various metrics, including: the evolution of several waveform parameters over time, ISI distribution,  pairwise correlations, crosscorrelations, quality metrics (Kleinfeld,2011), average waveform +/- std, (6) binned spike rate.
