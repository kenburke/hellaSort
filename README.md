# hellaSort
Semi-automatic neuronal spike sorting GUI written in MATLAB. 

This interactive GUI permits the user to explore their waveforms and either use a gaussian mixture model to cluster spikes or manually cluster in a 2D PCA space. 

The user can vary the number of clusters and assess the impact of the chosen clusters on various metrics, including: the evolution of several waveform parameters over time, ISI distribution,  pairwise correlations, crosscorrelations, quality metrics (Kleinfeld et al.,2011), average waveform +/- std, and binned spike rate over time.

The main "hellaSort.m" function calls a number of modules/functions that can be independently modified. 

To use the software, download and place into your MATLAB directory: 
(1) subroutines (i.e. functions) from the "subroutines" branch <https://github.com/mrunfeldt/hellaSort/tree/subroutines/subroutines> and place them within your MATLAB directory. 
(2) the main functions "hellaSort.m" and "raw2nev.m"

"RUNME_load_sort_exampleData.m" is a script that you can use to run hellaSort on some example neural data ("exampleData.mat") that is provided.

Have fun and post modifications!
